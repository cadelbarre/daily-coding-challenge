# PROBLEM NÂº 1

This problem was recently asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example:

```js
sumPairs([10, 15, 3, 7], 17); // return true. Since 10 + 7 is 17.
sumPairs([10, 15, 3, 7], 18); // return true. Since 15 + 3 is 18.
sumPairs([10, 15, 3, 7], 10); // return true. Since 3 + 7 is 10.
sumPairs([10, 15, 3, 7], 20); // return false. There is not two numbers add up to 20.
```
