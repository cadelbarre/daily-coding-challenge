# PROBLEM NÂº 2

_This problem was asked by Uber._

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example,

```JS
productAllNumber([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  // return [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]
productAllNumber([3, 2, 1])       // return [2, 3, 6]
```

**Follow-up: what if you can't use division?**

The next step is do the same without use division
